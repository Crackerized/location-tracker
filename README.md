Location Tracker Script

For anyone using Android devices, google is pulling your location history and storing it. It can be found at maps.google.com/locationhistory/
This is a quick script for programatically pulling that data and dumping it into a mongo db (meant to be run on a cron job daily). 

Side note:
Lets get a big round of applause for the pieces of human garbage at Google who insist on tracking everywhere we go and refuse to give us a decent API to access that data.
